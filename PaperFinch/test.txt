Brooklyn leaned both arms against the bar and stared holes into the bartender. He wiped the bar down with his dirty towel, not paying her any mind.
“I’m serious,” she said. The taxidermy antelope on the wall behind him watched her. “If you don’t want me to do it, I’ll just do it somewhere else. I really, really hate bothering people. I just want to show you guys some love.”
“It’s cool,” he said. The bar had to be clean at this point, given how much he was wiping it.
“Are you sure? It won’t be two minutes. I don’t want to be a bother.”
He threw the towel down against the bar. “If you ask again, the answer’s gonna be no.”
“Okay! Okay,” she said, and headed back to her table. It was a fine wooden table, and atop it was a plate of fried antelope in a bed of lettuce. It resembled chicken more than it did game meat, the breading turned a dark gold.
She pulled a ring light out of her backpack and set it behind the food. She flicked it on and squinted at the light. The device had been expensive when she was just starting out, but she secretly loved it, though it was embarrassing to haul around. It screamed ‘influencer’ in a way that she was sure bothered the people around her. She adjusted her hair, and then pulled a strand or two out of place—this was a trip to the desert, after all, and if she looked too made-up she may come across as inauthentic.
“Hey guys,” she said to the phone camera, presenting the plate of food for it. “It’s your girl Brooklyn. As you might know, I just started my trip to Big Bend National Park. My first stop is at Nature’s Auditorium, the most famous restaurant in beautiful Terlingua! This place is so cute, you guys, and it’s literally steps from the park entrance. Just look around! Everything here is so cool. And you just know I had to have the famous chicken fried antelope for dinner! Okay, let’s have our first bite.”
She took a big bite of the antelope—too big. The texture was grainy, a little gamey. Not something she would ever eat. She swallowed hard to get it down. “Mmm,” she said, nodding her head. “This is amazing, you guys! You have to come out here and try it. And you know I’m just a girl, so I had to get myself a little drink, let’s see here, the prickly pear margarita! This is gonna hit!”
She took a long sip from the colorful drink. Oh, yes. Sweet, prickly, exotic. Alcohol. She stopped herself from shivering. “That’s all I have for now. Love you guys! Remember, always be kind to each other! Thanks. Bye bye.”
She looked around at the other patrons as she put her ring light away. They ate their food and engaged in quiet conversation. No lingering stares, nobody telling her to get up and leave. Stares were part of the job, but she hated them all the same. She uploaded the post, and put her phone in her bag. For some reason being a social media personality made her less of a phone person—apps just felt like work. She put a few more bites of antelope down, just to get her money’s worth from it.
It was a strange and dreadful time to be in Far West Texas. The dying summer had brought hundred-degree temperatures as soon as the sun hit the morning air, and the heat lingered in the valleys and the plains as long as the long days lasted. The lizards of Big Bend would retreat under the rocks and brush to wait out the sun’s deadly gaze. The night would invariably suck the heat back into space, and the desert returned to life in the dark, the birds drinking from the flowers of dying agave americana, the hungry javelina feasting on grubs, the mountain lions stalking their prey.
At least, that was what she’d read online before coming. Check your boots, there might be a scorpion that crawled in while you slept. If you see a bear, don’t run, but also don’t let your kids get too far away from you. As if anyone would like to have a kid with her, she remembered thinking. Bring water. Every website seemed to mention water a dozen times. The simplest of hikes came with warnings—two gallons a day, eat salty snacks, you could die, you will die, you will become dehydrated and die right here if you come. Information about Big Bend seemed to be written by a cult of death that preached survival. Her backpack came with a two liter bladder, and she had a four liter collapsible bottle along with her regular small bottle she carried everywhere. It was a lot of weight, but was it enough? She couldn’t decide if she had been overthinking it.
Still, for some reason the desert had drawn her to it—maybe because of all those warnings. Her followers had started to check in with her during the planning process, which she’d posted about—Girl, are you gonna be safe out there? Girl, you know that’s by the border, right? She could do nothing but roll her eyes at those comments. She had had enough of the all-inclusive resorts, the beach houses, the ski trips (and the après-ski trips), the life of bottomless drinks she had clawed her way into. A beach was nice, but she wanted to be real for a change. She used to go hiking when she was in high school, out in the mountains, far from the concrete jungle of Los Angeles she called home. She just wanted to be a girl out in the desert, trying something new, seeing things she’d never seen before. If her followers didn’t respond to that, they could stuff it. She had made enough money.
The bartender tossed the check on her table. He had, in the intervening time between her starting and finishing her meal, rolled up his sleeves. “Traveling alone?” he asked.
Was he concerned for her? Or looking for his next conquest? “My husband’s waiting for me back at the hotel,” she smiled. That worked every time, even though it was a hilarious lie. She pressed the credit card into his hand and shooed him to the point of sale device.
She threw her sunglasses on after signing for the tip, and donned her sun hat. It was this huge woven thing, stylish, the kind of thing a lady might have worn a hundred years ago. In the desert, it was practical. She threw her bag over her shoulder and headed towards the exit.
A middle aged man sat at the bar with his own cup of liquor. He was bald, with the stubble growing in a kingly rim around the sides of his head, and pudgy, relaxed face. A mole sat on his left cheek. He looked like someone who could tell a good story. “The shooting has got to end,” he said to the bartender, who was no more interested in what he had to say than he had been with Brooklyn. “Whatever happened to el hermano mayor, that’s between him and God. He’s acting like a fool. And that general is not much better. It ain’t got nothing to do with me and you, that’s for sure.”
She put the phrase into her translation app. El hermano mayor. Spanish, it detected, and it meant ‘the big brother’. Who was the big brother? A good ghost story of some kind could play well in this place. Maybe she’d ask a couple locals. She pushed open the double doors and jogged down the porch into the dusty parking lot. A few characters were hanging out there—three members of a biker gang, smoking cigarettes, and a teenage couple kissing each other feverishly, the girl pushed up against her red Subaru.
She opened the back door of her old hatchback and threw her bag in. It was packed to the gills with all the gear she thought she’d need—a sleeping bag, sleeping pad, pillows, clothes, groceries, a stove, a poop shovel, toilet paper, her toiletries (so many toiletries), the list went on. The car was cute, but too small for her needs sometimes. It was the kind of car that couldn’t be bought anymore—too small and quirky for American’s big tastes. Her followers adored it, and so she’d kept it around. She suspected the video she made of her packing the car, complete with her trying and failing to tie a kayak to the roof rack of the car, would be more popular than the trip itself.
She started down the road. Terlingua is a ghost town, or at lound her, concerned faces floating above as she fell to her knees, but they were all muffled. Red through the wet filter of her tear-filled eyes was all she could see as she her head hit the dirt. Only, her mind kept falling, down and down, further into another place until her consciousness left her.
